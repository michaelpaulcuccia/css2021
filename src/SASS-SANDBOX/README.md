If you check out the sass web page and npm, node-sass is deprecated and Dart sass is what is current. I kept getting errors when I tried to compile using node-sass. Therefore, I installed Dart sass using npm install sass. To install as a dev dependency npm install --save-dev sass I created a css folder in the dist folder. Then for the script part in the package.json part of the video, I did "sass": "sass --watch scss:dist/css". So far, everything compiles and works and I haven't had any troubles. Here's the link. I highly recommend you check it out FIRST to get a better understanding of the code. It will be in the 'Preprocessing' part of the page. Here's what it says: You can watch and output to directories by using folder paths as your input and output, and separating them with a colon. In this example: sass --watch app/sass:public/stylesheets Sass would watch all files in the app/sass folder for changes, and compile CSS to the public/stylesheets folder. Hope this helps.
